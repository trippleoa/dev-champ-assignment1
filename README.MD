# ES6 Features Explained Simply

This project shows 8 cool features of modern JavaScript (ES6) with simple examples.
NB: THEY HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED/TALKED ABOUT MORE AS COMMENTS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FOLDERS.
1. **Classes** – A cleaner way to build objects and reuse code.
2. **Arrow Functions** – Shorter functions that make code easier to read.
3. **Variables (`let`, `const`)** – Better ways to store data safely compared to `var`.
4. **Array Methods** – Easy tools (like `map`, `filter`, `forEach`) to work with lists.
5. **Destructuring** – Quickly unpack values from arrays or objects.
6. **Modules** – Split code into files and reuse them anywhere.
7. **Ternary Operators** – Short, one-line way to write simple if/else.
8. **Spread Operators** – Copy or merge arrays/objects easily with `...`.
